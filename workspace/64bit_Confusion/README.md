# 64bit_Confusion 

This is a crackme from http://crackmes.de/. It is a elf64 compiled on Gentoo in 2004.
The crackme is solved and it is fairly easy one. However things have changed in Linux
for the last 13 years. There is incompatibility between current libc versions used then
and now. The resurection of the executable under modern Ubuntu was even more interesting
then the crackme itself.

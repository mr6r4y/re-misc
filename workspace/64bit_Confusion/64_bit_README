64bit_Confusion crack me

This crackme was written in Gentoo Linux for AMD64. It is a 64 bit
ELF executable object. 

This crackme runs a series of values through its lame algorithm
and checks your key (argv[1]) against that algorithms output.
The values are hard coded, it shouldnt be too hard to figure out.
The point of this crackme is to mislead you down the wrong path.

- Section header remains in place
- Anti ptrace()
- Misleading instructions (poor obfuscation)

Rules:
NO patching :)

Enjoy!
